	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p>Some of my hobbies include drawing, animating, and reading. I also recently learned how to knit. I'm  currently developing a story with some of the characters that I've created throughout the years. If you'd like to read more about it, you can refer back to my "Projects" page.</p>
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>A goal that I have for the future is to get into Pixar Animation Studio, or at least become an animator.</p>
