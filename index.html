	<h2>Hobbies/Goals</h2>
	<p>Some of my hobbies include drawing, animating, and reading. I also recently learned how to knit. A book that I'm currently reading is a book called "Eliza and Her Monsters" by Francesca Zappia. It's quite interesting. I'm also currently developing a story with some of the characters that I've created throughout the years. If you'd like to read more about it, you can refer back to my "Projects" page. A goal that I have for the future is to get into Pixar Animation Studio, or at least to become an animator. </p>
